Huge shout out as always to [TelepathicGrunt](https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt). Whenever I return to modding after a long break, his [structure tutorial](https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/StructureTutorialMod) is where I go first. At the time of writing, most comments in this repo come from either his structure tutorial or the neoforge mod template.
